# angular2-demo

## Task1:-  
Create a sample application in angular 2 (details mentioned below). Purpose of this application is to showcase how you utilize the various features offered by angular framework such as (components, services, directives, routing, forms, etc..) and apply best practices during development cycle. Also, if you could add some unit test to the code that will be really helpful.

#### Implement a Form with the following Inputs (and Validators)

##### 1.Mail address (is required and should be an email address)
         
##### 2.A Dropdown which allows the user to select from three different Subscriptions
          ("Basic", "Advanced", "Pro") Set "Advanced" as Default
         
##### 3.A Password field (is required and must be 8 character long with at least one character and one special character)
         
##### 4.A Submit Button and A Clear Button
         
##### ALERT1: 
Display a warning message if the Form is invalid and was touched but only after user has stopped typing. 
##### ALERT2:
Display a warning message below each input if it's invalid and cumulative message at the top of the form with all the errors at the top of the form on submit. 
##### CONFIRM1(Reset):
If form is modified and clear is clicked, prompt user confirming that they are sure to discard the changes.
